# Hacking NASA - Top Secret Project

Welcome to our super-secret project repository where we're boldly going where no one has gone before... straight into the clutches of the law! 🚀🔒

## Overview

Ever wondered what it would be like to hack into NASA? Well, wonder no more! This repository contains a groundbreaking script that simulates the exhilarating experience of hacking into NASA's top-secret servers. Disclaimer: Please don't attempt this in real life, or you might end up being featured on the next season of "Orange Is the New Black".

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine. Remember, the more clandestine the location, the better. 🕵️‍♂️

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the `hack_nasa.sh` script and watch in awe as it magically simulates the heart-pounding excitement of hacking NASA. Disclaimer: No actual hacking of NASA is occurring during the execution of this script. 🛑👾

3. **Enjoy the Show:** Sit back, relax, and enjoy the spectacle of fake progress bars filling your terminal window. Ah, the sweet taste of imaginary victory!
